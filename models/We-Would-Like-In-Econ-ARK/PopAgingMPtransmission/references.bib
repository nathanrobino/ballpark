               Households' ability to self-insure against these shocks depends

               borrowing occurs through the mortgage market and is influenced by
               the presence of government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs). We

               compared with 3 for a Gaussian distribution. The high kurtosis
               implies that in a given year, most individuals experience very
               small earnings shocks, and a small but non-negligible number
               experience very large shocks. Second, these statistical
               properties vary significantly both over the life cycle and with

              the extent to which they have access to informal insurance against
              this risk. We accomplish this task by using indirect inference to
              estimate a structural consumption–savings model, in which
              individuals both learn about the nature of their income process
              and partly insure shocks via informal mechanisms. In this
              framework, we estimate (i) the degree of partial insurance, (ii)
              the extent of systematic differences in income growth rates, (iii)
              the precision with which individuals know their own income growth
              rates when they begin their working lives, (iv) the persistence of
              typical labor income shocks, (v) the tightness of borrowing
              constraints, and (vi) the amount of measurement error in the data.
              In implementing indirect inference, we find that an auxiliary
              model that approximates the true structural equations of the model
              (which are not estimable) works very well, with negligible small

              are moderately persistent, systematic differences in income growth
              rates are large, individuals have substantial amounts of
              information about their income growth rates, and about one‐half of

              the classical Baumol-Tobin model of money demand into the
              workhorse incomplete-markets life-cycle economy. In this

              to transfer funds between a transactions account from which
              consumption must be financed and an investment portfolio of equity
              and riskless bonds. Transfers of funds are subject to a
              transactions cost that reduces wealth and consists of two
              components: one is proportional to the amount of assets
              transferred, and the other is a fixed resource cost. Because it is
              costly to transfer funds, the consumer may choose not to transfer
              any funds on a particular observation date. In general, the
              optimal adjustment rule—including the size and direction of
              transfers, and the time of the next observation—is

  abstract    = "In this paper we revisit two well-known facts regarding
                 lifecycle expenditures. The first is the familiar ``hump''
                 shaped lifecycle profile of nondurable expenditures. We
                 document that the behavior of total nondurables masks
                 surprising heterogeneity in the lifecycle profile of individual
                 sub-components. We find, for example, that while food
                 expenditures decline after middle age, expenditures on
                 entertainment continue to increase throughout the lifecycle.
                 These patterns pose a challenge to models that emphasize
                 inter-temporal substitution or movements in income, including
                 standard models of precautionary savings, myopia, and limited
                 commitment, to explain the lifecycle profile of expenditures.
                 Second, we document that the increase in the cross-sectional
                 dispersion of expenditure over the lifecycle is not greater for
                 luxuries. In particular, the dispersion in entertainment
                 expenditure declines relative to food expenditures as
                 households become older, casting further doubt on theories that
                 emphasize (exclusively) shocks to permanent income to explain
                 the rising cross sectional expenditure dispersion over the
                 lifecycle. We propose and test a Beckerian model that
                 emphasizes intra-temporal substitution between time and
                 expenditures as the opportunity cost of time varies over the
                 lifecycle. We find this alternative model successfully explains
                 the joint behavior of food and entertainment expenditures in
                 the latter half of the lifecycle. The model, however, is less
                 successful in explaining expenditure patterns early in the

               for savings of population aging. In doing so, I pay particular
               attention to some features that have been partially over-looked
               in the literature. These features include the details of the
               population aging process, the initial conditions with respect to
               assets holdings, and the relation between age and household size.
               In order to do so, I develop recursive methods capable of dealing
               with overlapping generations environments where the population is
               stochastic. The main findings are: i) If population patterns
               revert to the averages of the last 50 years, the reduction in
               aggregate savings due to changes in the age structure of the
               population is small. ii) If, however, the demographic process is
               such that fertility patterns remain at their current low levels,
               then the effects of the aging of the baby boom are very large.
               iii) Initial conditions matter: both the choice for initial
               assets and the choice for the mechanism through which current
               fertility reverts to its long run average have implications for
               the economic allocations. And iv) The contribution of general
               equilibrium effects is to exacerbate the reduction of savings
               since population aging tends to make labor relatively scarce,
               and, therefore, to reduce rates of return of capital, which in
               turn reduces savings even further.",

               inflation in Canada that arise through the revaluation of nominal
               assets and liabilities. We find that the effects are non‐trivial
               even for low inflation episodes. The main winners are young,
               middle‐class households with mortgage debt. The government
               receives a windfall gain from its long‐term debt. The old, the
               rich or the middle‐aged, middle‐class lose, largely owing to
               their holdings of bonds and non‐indexed defined benefit pension
               assets. Finally, our Canada‐U.S. comparison reveals that the
               extent of redistributions can be quite different even between
               countries of similar economic and legal environments.",

              cash inventory model to a dynamic environment that allows for the
              possibility of withdrawing cash at random times at a low cost.
              This modification introduces a precautionary motive for holding
              cash and naturally captures developments in withdrawal technology,
              such as the increasing diffusion of bank branches and ATM
              terminals. We characterize the solution of the model and show that
              qualitatively it is able to reproduce the empirical patterns.
              Estimating the structural parameters we show that the model
              quantitatively accounts for key features of the data. The
              estimates are used to quantify the expenditure and interest rate

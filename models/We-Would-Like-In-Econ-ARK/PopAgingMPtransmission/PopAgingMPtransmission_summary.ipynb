        "Demographics and monetary policy transmission had been studied in largely separate literatures. Work on demographics ({cite:t}`Auerbach1984-qt,Auerbach1989-nb`; {cite:t}`Rios-Rull1996-jp,Rios-Rull2001-fa`) analyzed how aging affects capital accumulation and asset prices, while work on transmission ({cite:t}`Kaplan2014-ee`; {cite:t}`Auclert2019-dr`; {cite:t}`Mian2013-wr`) showed how household balance-sheet heterogeneity shapes consumption responses to interest rates. A small literature ({cite:t}`Imam2015-ee`; {cite:t}`Juselius2015-dk`) had documented correlations between aging and weaker monetary transmission, but without structural foundations. {cite:t}`Wong2016-ud` was among the first to explicitly link population aging to monetary policy effectiveness through age-varying consumption responses.\n",
